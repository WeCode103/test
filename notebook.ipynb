    "## My Programmin Approach:\n",
    " Before writing the code, I _analyse the problems_ of the program to be written. Then, I implement the the solutions to the probelms.  \n",
    " If the program looks complicate I prefer to use **the pseudocode or Algorithm**. This makes my programming efficient and simple.  \n",
    " I try to write the complicate programming based on algorithm. \n",
    " ### What my algorithm Consists:\n",
    " It depends on program but seems the program mainly need to use hadnling the errors like run time errors and logical errors.  \n",
    " For handling errors I use two kind of styles:\n",
    " 1. LBYL (Look Before you Leap):\n",
    "  I use this approach mainly _to validate bad input of user errors._ The user errors can produce the output in wrong way than it is expected to be. \n",
    "  LBYL **approach can be resolved using `if-else` or `elif` structure.**\n",
    " 2. EAFP (Easier to ask Forgiveness than Permission):\n",
    "  I use EAFP _to prevent crashing of the program._ The errors like `ValueError`, `ZeroDivision`, `FileNotFound` can be resolved using `try except` structure.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### List of Software Tools I use:\n",
    " 1. VS-Code(Visual Studio Code):\n",
    "   It is an **Integrated Development Environment** where I can run py script,modules and notebook files. It is very helpful as it comes with loads of extensions which help my workflow convinient.\n",
    "   Extensions like Markdown, GitHub Copilot Chat, Jupyter, Python, Pylance,etc.\n",
    " 2. Chat-GPT (AI buddy coder):\n",
    "    I use this AI for interactive learning, I never try to copy paste the coding problem neither on my assesments nor on my personal learning time. I rather use it to analyse the problem, help me to make an algorithm of the program or debugging the code. \n",
    " 3. Git and Github:\n",
    "    Git is a version control distributed system which help me to remotely develop my programming work and push into it. The git hub is the platform which is collaborating development software . It is essential for my assesments, group projects\n",
